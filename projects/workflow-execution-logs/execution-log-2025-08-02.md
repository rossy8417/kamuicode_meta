# Workflow Execution Log - 2025-08-02

## WebSearch Testing and Validation

### [15:17:50] [START] kyoto-food-trend-test.yml
Issue: Testing Claude Code WebSearch functionality in GitHub Actions
Action: Created simple test workflow with npx claude-code -p command
Result: Workflow started but taking too long (5+ minutes)

### [15:23:29] [CANCELLED] kyoto-food-trend-test.yml
Issue: Workflow execution taking too long without output
Action: Cancelled workflow after 5 minutes
Result: Need simpler test approach

### [15:25:00] [START] test-websearch-simple.yml
Issue: Need to verify WebSearch actually works
Action: Created minimal test with just WebSearch query
Result: Success in 1m3s

### [15:26:04] [SUCCESS] test-websearch-simple.yml
Issue: Confirming WebSearch returns real data
Action: Simple query "京都の食べ物トレンドについてWebSearchツールで検索"
Result: Got actual search results about Kyoto food trends (Korean/Asian cuisine, health-focused items)

### [15:28:17] [START] test-websearch-factcheck.yml
Issue: Need to verify WebSearch is accessing real web, not Claude's knowledge
Action: Created comprehensive fact-check workflow with:
  - Real-time data test (today's date and weather)
  - Recent news search (August 2025 Kyoto news)
  - Specific restaurant verification
Result: Success in 4m1s

### [15:32:00] [SUCCESS] test-websearch-factcheck.yml
Issue: Fact-checking WebSearch results
Action: Retrieved and analyzed results
Result: Confirmed WebSearch is working:
  - Got actual news from July 30, August 1, 2025
  - Retrieved specific URLs (Nikkei, Kyoto Shimbun)
  - Found detailed restaurant info with current reviews
  - All data includes source URLs and recent dates

## Key Findings

### WebSearch Tool Confirmation
- ✅ WebSearch tool works with Claude Code CLI
- ✅ Returns real-time web data, not just Claude's knowledge
- ✅ Includes source URLs and current dates
- ✅ Can be used with -p parameter in GitHub Actions

### Implementation Pattern

## Directory Structure Updates

### [01:05:00] [UPDATE] Project Output Structure
Issue: Consolidate all GitHub Actions outputs to projects/ directory
Action: Updated CLAUDE.md to clarify output structure:
  - Meta-workflow (issue-driven): projects/issue-{number}-{timestamp}/
    - Generated workflows go to generated-workflow/
    - Validation reports go to validation-report/
  - Generated workflows: projects/{workflow-name}-{timestamp}/
    - Media files go to media/ (images, videos, audio, 3d)
    - Final deliverables go to final/
Result: Clear separation between workflow generation and media generation outputs

### [01:06:00] [CLEANUP] Remove current-session
Issue: current-session directory is unnecessary
Action: Removed projects/current-session/ and updated all references to use timestamped directories
Result: Consistent naming pattern for all workflow outputs
```bash
npx @anthropic-ai/claude-code \
  -p "YOUR_SEARCH_PROMPT" \
  --allowedTools "WebSearch,Write" \
  --permission-mode "acceptEdits"
```

## Issues Resolved

### Issue: Workflow file reference error
Error: "invalid value workflow reference: no version specified"
Cause: Using `uses: ./minimal-units/...` which GitHub Actions doesn't support
Solution: Need to inline minimal unit implementations instead of using references

### Issue: Long execution times
Error: Workflows taking 5+ minutes for simple searches
Cause: Complex prompts with file writing requirements
Solution: Simplified prompts work faster (1-2 minutes)

## Next Steps
1. Create/update minimal units for WebSearch and FactCheck
2. Fix meta-workflow to generate inline implementations instead of uses: references
3. Create Kyoto food trend video workflow with WebSearch integration

## Dynamic Workflow 60 Execution

### [15:45:00] [ATTEMPT] dynamic-workflow-60.yml
Issue: Workflow uses `uses: ./minimal-units/...` references which don't work
Action: Need to fix by inlining the minimal unit implementations
Result: Pending fix

### [16:00:00] [FIXED] dynamic-workflow-60-fixed.yml
Issue: Original workflow had `uses:` references to local files
Action: Created fixed version with inline implementations:
  - Inlined web-search-claude.yml steps
  - Inlined planning-ccsdk.yml steps
  - Converted all MCP calls to npx claude-code format
  - Added input parameter for topic customization
Result: Created dynamic-workflow-60-fixed.yml ready for execution

### [16:52:11] [RUNNING] dynamic-workflow-60.yml
Issue: Running fixed workflow to create Kyoto food trend video
Action: Started workflow with topic="京都の食べ物トレンド"
Result: Workflow in progress - Run ID: 16695260820

### [16:57:18] [FAILED] dynamic-workflow-60.yml
Issue: Workflow failed in image generation step
Error: 
  1. File paths using absolute paths instead of needs.setup.outputs.project_dir
  2. MCP tool name incorrect (should be without mcp__ prefix in Claude Code)
  3. Output directory not properly referenced
Action: Need to fix path references and MCP tool names
Result: Failed after 5m7s

### [17:05:00] [FIXED] dynamic-workflow-60-v2.yml
Issue: Previous version had absolute path issues
Action: Created v2 with fixes:
  - All absolute paths changed to use ${{ needs.setup.outputs.project_dir }}
  - Added Checkout Repository to all jobs for file access
  - Kept MCP tool names with mcp__ prefix (seems required)
Result: Created dynamic-workflow-60-v2.yml ready for testing

### [17:01:48] [RUNNING] dynamic-workflow-60-v2.yml
Issue: Testing v2 with path fixes
Action: Started workflow with topic="京都の食べ物トレンド"
Result: Workflow in progress - Run ID: 16695329833

### [17:09:00] [FAILED] dynamic-workflow-60-v2.yml
Issue: Workflow failed - MCP tools not recognized
Error:
  1. Claude Code cannot find MCP tools with mcp__ prefix
  2. Error: "The MCP tool `mcp__t2i-google-imagen3__imagen_t2i` is not available"
  3. Same issue with all MCP tools (image, audio, video generation)
Action: Need different approach - MCP tools may not work in GitHub Actions
Result: Failed after 7m12s

### [17:18:26] [SUCCESS] test-mcp-naming.yml
Issue: Testing MCP tool naming conventions
Discovery: 
  1. MCP tools are NOT available for direct Claude Code CLI calls
  2. "The MCP services are configured for GitHub Actions workflows, not direct CLI access"
  3. MCP tools are designed to work as HTTP requests with proper authentication
  4. Claude Code CLI cannot invoke MCP tools directly
Action: Need to use external API calls or different approach
Result: Critical discovery - MCP tools require HTTP implementation

### [17:25:00] [FIXED] dynamic-workflow-60-v3.yml
Issue: Previous versions missing --mcp-config option
Action: Created v3 based on video-content-creation-production-v8.yml pattern:
  - Added --mcp-config ".claude/mcp-kamuicode.json" to all MCP calls
  - Using correct mcp__ prefix for tool names
  - Simplified prompts for clarity
Result: v3 created with proper MCP configuration

### [17:25:30] [RUNNING] dynamic-workflow-60-v3.yml
Issue: Testing v3 with proper MCP configuration
Action: Started workflow with topic="京都の食べ物トレンド"
Result: Workflow started

### [17:32:00] [FAILED] dynamic-workflow-60-v3.yml
Issue: Workflow failed at lipsync stage
Error:
  1. All generation steps succeeded (image, audio, video)
  2. Files were generated correctly (audio: 74KB, video: 3.2MB)
  3. But lipsync step couldn't access files - reported as 0 bytes
  4. Root cause: Missing artifact upload/download between jobs
  5. Each job runs in isolated environment without file sharing
Action: Need to add artifact upload/download steps
Result: Failed at post-production - file sharing issue between jobs

### [17:50:00] [FIXED] dynamic-workflow-60-v4.yml
Issue: Previous versions missing artifact sharing between jobs
Action: Created v4 with comprehensive fixes:
  - Added artifact upload after each generation job (image, audio, video)
  - Added artifact download before post-production job
  - Preserved all MCP configurations from v3
  - Added file existence verification steps
Result: v4 created and pushed to GitHub, ready for testing

## Dynamic Workflow v4 Testing
