# Workflow Execution Log - 2025-08-02

## WebSearch Testing and Validation

### [15:17:50] [START] kyoto-food-trend-test.yml
Issue: Testing Claude Code WebSearch functionality in GitHub Actions
Action: Created simple test workflow with npx claude-code -p command
Result: Workflow started but taking too long (5+ minutes)

### [15:23:29] [CANCELLED] kyoto-food-trend-test.yml
Issue: Workflow execution taking too long without output
Action: Cancelled workflow after 5 minutes
Result: Need simpler test approach

### [15:25:00] [START] test-websearch-simple.yml
Issue: Need to verify WebSearch actually works
Action: Created minimal test with just WebSearch query
Result: Success in 1m3s

### [15:26:04] [SUCCESS] test-websearch-simple.yml
Issue: Confirming WebSearch returns real data
Action: Simple query "京都の食べ物トレンドについてWebSearchツールで検索"
Result: Got actual search results about Kyoto food trends (Korean/Asian cuisine, health-focused items)

### [15:28:17] [START] test-websearch-factcheck.yml
Issue: Need to verify WebSearch is accessing real web, not Claude's knowledge
Action: Created comprehensive fact-check workflow with:
  - Real-time data test (today's date and weather)
  - Recent news search (August 2025 Kyoto news)
  - Specific restaurant verification
Result: Success in 4m1s

### [15:32:00] [SUCCESS] test-websearch-factcheck.yml
Issue: Fact-checking WebSearch results
Action: Retrieved and analyzed results
Result: Confirmed WebSearch is working:
  - Got actual news from July 30, August 1, 2025
  - Retrieved specific URLs (Nikkei, Kyoto Shimbun)
  - Found detailed restaurant info with current reviews
  - All data includes source URLs and recent dates

## Key Findings

### WebSearch Tool Confirmation
- ✅ WebSearch tool works with Claude Code CLI
- ✅ Returns real-time web data, not just Claude's knowledge
- ✅ Includes source URLs and current dates
- ✅ Can be used with -p parameter in GitHub Actions

### Implementation Pattern
```bash
npx @anthropic-ai/claude-code \
  -p "YOUR_SEARCH_PROMPT" \
  --allowedTools "WebSearch,Write" \
  --permission-mode "acceptEdits"
```

## Issues Resolved

### Issue: Workflow file reference error
Error: "invalid value workflow reference: no version specified"
Cause: Using `uses: ./minimal-units/...` which GitHub Actions doesn't support
Solution: Need to inline minimal unit implementations instead of using references

### Issue: Long execution times
Error: Workflows taking 5+ minutes for simple searches
Cause: Complex prompts with file writing requirements
Solution: Simplified prompts work faster (1-2 minutes)

## Next Steps
1. Create/update minimal units for WebSearch and FactCheck
2. Fix meta-workflow to generate inline implementations instead of uses: references
3. Create Kyoto food trend video workflow with WebSearch integration

## Dynamic Workflow 60 Execution

### [15:45:00] [ATTEMPT] dynamic-workflow-60.yml
Issue: Workflow uses `uses: ./minimal-units/...` references which don't work
Action: Need to fix by inlining the minimal unit implementations
Result: Pending fix

### [16:00:00] [FIXED] dynamic-workflow-60-fixed.yml
Issue: Original workflow had `uses:` references to local files
Action: Created fixed version with inline implementations:
  - Inlined web-search-claude.yml steps
  - Inlined planning-ccsdk.yml steps
  - Converted all MCP calls to npx claude-code format
  - Added input parameter for topic customization
Result: Created dynamic-workflow-60-fixed.yml ready for execution

### [16:52:11] [RUNNING] dynamic-workflow-60.yml
Issue: Running fixed workflow to create Kyoto food trend video
Action: Started workflow with topic="京都の食べ物トレンド"
Result: Workflow in progress - Run ID: 16695260820

### [16:57:18] [FAILED] dynamic-workflow-60.yml
Issue: Workflow failed in image generation step
Error: 
  1. File paths using absolute paths instead of needs.setup.outputs.project_dir
  2. MCP tool name incorrect (should be without mcp__ prefix in Claude Code)
  3. Output directory not properly referenced
Action: Need to fix path references and MCP tool names
Result: Failed after 5m7s

### [17:05:00] [FIXED] dynamic-workflow-60-v2.yml
Issue: Previous version had absolute path issues
Action: Created v2 with fixes:
  - All absolute paths changed to use ${{ needs.setup.outputs.project_dir }}
  - Added Checkout Repository to all jobs for file access
  - Kept MCP tool names with mcp__ prefix (seems required)
Result: Created dynamic-workflow-60-v2.yml ready for testing
