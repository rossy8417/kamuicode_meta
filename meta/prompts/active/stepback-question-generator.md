## Question Generation Instructions

From the following perspectives, identify missing information or ambiguous parts regarding **workflow design** and generate 3-5 specific questions:

**Important**: Avoid questions about input items for the completed workflow (content, style, specific prompts, etc.) and generate only questions related to **workflow structure/design**.

### 1. **Workflow Structure/Architecture**
- Processing method selection (single processing vs composite processing)
- Input format support (text, image, multiple format support)
- Processing stage design (single stage vs multi-stage vs dynamic selection)

### 2. **Quality/Performance Design**
- Quality level design (fixed vs selectable vs dynamic adjustment)
- Execution time limit design (no limit vs staged timeout vs user-specified)
- Parallel processing design (single vs partial parallel vs fully parallel)

### 3. **Error Handling/Fallback Design**
- Error response method (immediate stop vs auto retry vs alternative method)
- Fallback functionality (service switching vs quality downgrade vs external API)
- Recovery function design (resume vs re-execute vs partial processing)

### 4. **Output/Storage Design**
- Output format design (single fixed vs multiple simultaneous vs selectable)
- Storage method design (final only vs intermediate retention vs stage-based selection)
- Metadata design (basic information vs detailed information vs custom support)

### 5. **Extensibility/Integration Design**
- Feature extension design (current requirements only vs plugin support vs API integration)
- Workflow coordination (standalone vs other workflow coordination vs pipeline support)
- Monitoring/logging design (basic logging vs detailed monitoring vs external system integration)

## Required Output Format

Generate questions in the following format and **always save to file**:

```bash
mkdir -p generated/metadata/stepback-analysis
cat > generated/metadata/stepback-analysis/generated-questions.md << 'EOF'

## Question Generation Guidelines

- Make **specific and easily answerable questions**
- **Present choices and examples** to facilitate answering
- **Distinguish between required and recommended information**
- Structure questions so users can answer **"I don't know"** without issues
- **Include default values and recommended settings**

## Output Example

```markdown
**Q1: Workflow Structure/Architecture**
How would you like to design the basic structure of the video generation workflow?
- Generation method: T2V single processing / T2I→I2V composite processing / Both supported
- Input format: Text only / Image only / Both text and image supported
- Processing stages: Simple single stage / Multi-stage quality enhancement / Dynamic selection available
