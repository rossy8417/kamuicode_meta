  - MUST share data between jobs via artifacts

breakdown:
  data_collection:
    - MUST save datasets to ${PROJECT_DIR}/data/
  modeling:
    - SHOULD save models to ${PROJECT_DIR}/models/
  reporting:
    - MUST export report to ${PROJECT_DIR}/final/report.pdf (or .md)

file_layout:
  - data: ${PROJECT_DIR}/data/
  - models: ${PROJECT_DIR}/models/
  - final: ${PROJECT_DIR}/final/
  - metadata: ${PROJECT_DIR}/metadata/

validation:
  - MUST verify report and model artifacts exist
