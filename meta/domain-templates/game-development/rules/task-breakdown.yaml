# Task breakdown rules (Game Development)
# Purpose: Decompose game dev tasks into atomic CI steps.

version: 1
scope: game_development

principles:
  - MUST write all outputs under ${PROJECT_DIR}
  - MUST avoid local path in `uses:`; use `run`
  - MUST share data between jobs via artifacts

breakdown:
  setup:
    - MUST install engine/dependencies
  build:
    - MUST produce build to ${PROJECT_DIR}/build/
  test:
    - SHOULD run automated tests, save to ${PROJECT_DIR}/reports/

file_layout:
  - build: ${PROJECT_DIR}/build/
  - reports: ${PROJECT_DIR}/reports/
  - metadata: ${PROJECT_DIR}/metadata/

validation:
  - MUST verify build artifacts exist
