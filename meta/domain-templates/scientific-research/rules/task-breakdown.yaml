# Purpose: Decompose research tasks into atomic steps.

version: 1
scope: scientific_research

principles:
  - MUST write all outputs under ${PROJECT_DIR}
  - MUST avoid local path in `uses:`; implement with `run`
  - MUST share data between jobs via artifacts

breakdown:
  literature_review:
    - SHOULD export findings to ${PROJECT_DIR}/metadata/papers.json
  data_pipeline:
    - MUST fetch/clean data to ${PROJECT_DIR}/data/
  analysis:
    - MUST run notebooks/scripts, save results to ${PROJECT_DIR}/results/
  visualization:
    - SHOULD save charts to ${PROJECT_DIR}/media/charts/

file_layout:
  - data: ${PROJECT_DIR}/data/
  - results: ${PROJECT_DIR}/results/
  - media: ${PROJECT_DIR}/media/
  - metadata: ${PROJECT_DIR}/metadata/

validation:
  - MUST verify results and figures exist for report
