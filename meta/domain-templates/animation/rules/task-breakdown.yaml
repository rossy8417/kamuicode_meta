# Task breakdown rules (Animation)
# Purpose: Decompose animation tasks into atomic steps.

version: 1
scope: animation

principles:
  - MUST write all outputs under ${PROJECT_DIR}
  - MUST avoid local path in `uses:`; use `run`
  - MUST share data between jobs via artifacts

breakdown:
  storyboard:
    - SHOULD create shots.json
  assets:
    - SHOULD prepare characters/backgrounds to ${PROJECT_DIR}/media/
  animation:
    - SHOULD render scenes to ${PROJECT_DIR}/media/videos/

file_layout:
  - media: ${PROJECT_DIR}/media/
  - metadata: ${PROJECT_DIR}/metadata/
  - final: ${PROJECT_DIR}/final/

validation:
  - MUST verify scenes exist and match storyboard
