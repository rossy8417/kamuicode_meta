# Purpose: Decompose curation tasks into atomic steps.

version: 1
scope: news_curation

principles:
  - MUST write all outputs under ${PROJECT_DIR}
  - MUST avoid local path in `uses:`; use `run`
  - MUST share data between jobs via artifacts

breakdown:
  sourcing:
    - MUST store sources to ${PROJECT_DIR}/metadata/sources.json
  summarization:
    - SHOULD create summaries.json
  packaging:
    - SHOULD export curated_feed.json to ${PROJECT_DIR}/final/

file_layout:
  - metadata: ${PROJECT_DIR}/metadata/
  - final: ${PROJECT_DIR}/final/

validation:
  - MUST verify curated_feed contains summarized items
