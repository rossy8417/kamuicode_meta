# Task breakdown rules (3D Modeling)
# Purpose: Decompose 3D modeling tasks into atomic steps.

version: 1
scope: 3d_modeling

principles:
  - MUST write all outputs under ${PROJECT_DIR}
  - MUST avoid local path in `uses:`; use `run`
  - MUST share data between jobs via artifacts

breakdown:
  modeling:
    - SHOULD export models to ${PROJECT_DIR}/models/
  texturing:
    - SHOULD save textures to ${PROJECT_DIR}/assets/textures/
  rendering:
    - SHOULD render previews to ${PROJECT_DIR}/media/renders/

file_layout:
  - models: ${PROJECT_DIR}/models/
  - assets: ${PROJECT_DIR}/assets/
  - media: ${PROJECT_DIR}/media/
  - metadata: ${PROJECT_DIR}/metadata/

validation:
  - MUST verify model files and previews exist
