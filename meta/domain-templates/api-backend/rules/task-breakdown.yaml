# Task breakdown rules (API Backend)
# Purpose: Decompose backend tasks into atomic CI steps.

version: 1
scope: api_backend

principles:
  - MUST write all outputs under ${PROJECT_DIR}
  - MUST avoid local path in `uses:`; use `run`
  - MUST share data between jobs via artifacts

breakdown:
  schema:
    - MUST export openapi.json/yaml to ${PROJECT_DIR}/metadata/
  build:
    - MUST produce server build to ${PROJECT_DIR}/build/
  test:
    - MUST run tests and save reports to ${PROJECT_DIR}/reports/
  package:
    - SHOULD create container/bundle to ${PROJECT_DIR}/final/

file_layout:
  - build: ${PROJECT_DIR}/build/
  - reports: ${PROJECT_DIR}/reports/
  - final: ${PROJECT_DIR}/final/
  - metadata: ${PROJECT_DIR}/metadata/

validation:
  - MUST verify schema/build/tests before package
