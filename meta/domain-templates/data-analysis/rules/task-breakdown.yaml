# Task breakdown rules (Data Analysis)
# Purpose: Decompose data analysis tasks into atomic steps.

version: 1
scope: data_analysis

principles:
  - MUST write all outputs under ${PROJECT_DIR}
  - MUST avoid local path in `uses:`; use `run`
  - MUST share data between jobs via artifacts

breakdown:
  ingestion:
    - MUST save raw data to ${PROJECT_DIR}/data/raw/
  processing:
    - MUST save cleaned data to ${PROJECT_DIR}/data/clean/
  analysis:
    - SHOULD save results to ${PROJECT_DIR}/results/
  visualization:
    - SHOULD save charts to ${PROJECT_DIR}/media/charts/

file_layout:
  - data: ${PROJECT_DIR}/data/
  - results: ${PROJECT_DIR}/results/
  - media: ${PROJECT_DIR}/media/
  - metadata: ${PROJECT_DIR}/metadata/

validation:
  - MUST verify results/charts exist when required
