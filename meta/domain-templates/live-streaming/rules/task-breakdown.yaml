# Task breakdown rules (Live Streaming)
# Purpose: Decompose live workflow into atomic steps.

version: 1
scope: live_streaming

principles:
  - MUST write all outputs under ${PROJECT_DIR}
  - MUST avoid local path in `uses:`; use `run`
  - MUST share data between jobs via artifacts

breakdown:
  setup:
    - SHOULD create streaming_plan.json
  asset_prep:
    - SHOULD prepare overlays/scenes to ${PROJECT_DIR}/media/
  rehearsal:
    - SHOULD run checks and output checklist to ${PROJECT_DIR}/metadata/

file_layout:
  - media: ${PROJECT_DIR}/media/
  - metadata: ${PROJECT_DIR}/metadata/
  - final: ${PROJECT_DIR}/final/

validation:
  - MUST verify assets and plan before go-live
