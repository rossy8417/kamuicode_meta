  "detailed_comparison_results": {
    "structure_from": "original",
    "structure_reasoning": "Original approach provides superior phase-based organization with clearer logical flow and better readability. 11 sequential phases are more intuitive than 21 modular jobs requiring external module understanding.",
    
    "dependency_management_from": "original", 
    "dependency_reasoning": "Original approach uses self-contained dependency resolution with strict data-flow management, making it more reliable than orchestrator's external module dependencies requiring 17 modules.",
    
    "parallelization_from": "orchestrator",
    "parallelization_reasoning": "Orchestrator approach demonstrates better parallel efficiency with 4-way parallel execution and shorter duration (35-63 vs 75-105 minutes), though original has better dependency management within parallel groups.",
    
    "error_handling_from": "original",
    "error_handling_reasoning": "Original provides comprehensive 4-layer error handling (API fallbacks, file validation, quality gates, graceful degradation) compared to orchestrator's basic conditional execution and retry logic.",
    
    "extensibility_from": "orchestrator", 
    "extensibility_reasoning": "Orchestrator excels in modularity and reusability with high maintainability and scalability, though at the cost of complexity in module dependency management.",
    
    "integration_approach_from": "original",
    "integration_reasoning": "Original better integrates minimal unit concepts with direct job extraction and composition (28 units across 8 categories) vs orchestrator's module abstraction approach."
