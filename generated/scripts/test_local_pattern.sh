claude -p "TEST: Video generation with mandatory download pattern

CRITICAL: Follow LOCAL SUCCESS PATTERN that works:
'For images/videos/3D generation: After generation completes, ALWAYS do URL download and open. Download to current directory. Always use full authenticated URL path (long for Google, short for FAL). No abbreviations. For I2V/I2I inputs use Google URLs, no abbreviations (not file paths!). Show saved file location with full path from ~.'

TASK: Test video generation for scene 1

STEP 1: Read image info and simulate video generation
1. Read scene_1_image_info.json
2. Extract image_url
3. Show that you would use i2v-fal-hailuo-02-pro with this URL
4. Simulate getting a video URL result

STEP 2: DEMONSTRATE DOWNLOAD PATTERN
5. Show exactly how you would download the video
6. Demonstrate: curl -o 'scene_1_video.mp4' '<FULL_VIDEO_URL>'
7. Show verification: ls -la scene_1_video.mp4

REQUIREMENTS:
- Show the complete workflow process
- Demonstrate proper URL handling (no abbreviations)
- Show file verification steps" \
