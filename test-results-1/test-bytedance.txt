Conclusion:
The ByteDance Seedance V1 Lite service appears to be properly configured and available, but requires user permission to execute. This is expected behavior for MCP services that haven't been pre-authorized.

Next Steps:
1. User needs to grant permission when prompted
2. Or configure auto-approval for this MCP service
3. Once permission is granted, the service should work normally

Service appears to be: WORKING (pending permissions)
